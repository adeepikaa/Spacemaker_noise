data.zip:                Zip file containing the datasets and npy files for configurations. 
                         Code assumes zip file is in working directory

data/ :                  Folder containing datasets and few *npy files containing data

graphs/ :                Folder containing exploration plots generated. 


This project code was done in a modular fashion before combining into a final code 
to minimize accidental errors and collaboration. Hence, all other *R files are the modules
used before developing the master file. They need to be run in the follwoing order.

spacemaker_read_data.R:  Code for data reading and wrangling
data_explore.R:          Code for exploring given data
spacemaker_dist_stats.R: Code to create features
feature_explore.R:       Code to explore features
create_train_test_sets.R:Code to create train and test sets
model_results.R:         Code to run different models and final results
