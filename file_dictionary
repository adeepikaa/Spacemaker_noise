Spacemaker_master:       The Master R code for the Noise Surrogate Models

Spacemaker_proj.pptx:    PowerPoint Presentation of the project

Spacemaker_summary.pdf:  Executive Summary of the project

data.zip:                Zip file containing the datasets and npy files for configurations. 
                         Code assumes zip file is in working directory

data/ :                  Folder containing datasets and few *npy files containing data

graphs/ :                Folder containing exploration plots generated. 


This project code was done in a modular fashion before combining into a final code 
to minimize accidental errors and collaboration. Hence, all other *R files are the modules
used before developing the master file. These files may not be updated.
