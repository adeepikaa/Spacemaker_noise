Introduction:

Noise Pollution refers to excessive amounts of noise that interfere with the natural bio-rhythms of everyday life. 
Spacemaker AI developed technology to discover smarter ways to maximize building potential
At Spacemaker AI, noise pollution is an important aspect of urban design. A challenge for noise calculation is high computational demand limits, hence surrogate models are important research topics. 

This project researches noise surrogate models to best estimate the fraction of yellow-zone for a specific site.
